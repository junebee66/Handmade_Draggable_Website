# 🤲🏻 Hand-made Website: Draggable
This is a page of an interdisciplinary project matrix. The intension is to show the overlapping qualities of different projects and through their differences the users will be able to see the potential in the ideas when they come together. When navigating the website, users can drag the project boxes from the bottom horizontal scrolling bar onto the top four boxes to remix my projects and generate new project possibilities. The new project possibility will be displayed on the left vertical grey box. The four boxes stands for themes, presentation, focus, and strategy/tools.
